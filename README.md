# Master-Thesis
<p align="justify"> This study aims to explore the performance of asset pricing anomalies across global markets using 153
characteristics from the work of Jessen, Kelly, and Pedersen. The objective is to investigate the extent
of anomaly performance decline before and after its discovery by academia, and compare results with
the US, serving as our benchmark. By employing zero-cost portfolios, we analyze the decline through
regressions of characteristic returns against market returns. Our results demonstrate a decline in
anomaly performance across all markets, with a consistent magnitude of decrease observed within each
MSCI classification. However, the decline is more pronounced in emerging markets. These findings
suggest that the US market’s results hold true for other markets, but discrepancies in magnitude exist,
particularly in emerging markets. This study’s contribution to the literature on asset pricing anomalies
lies in its provision of new insights into their performance decline across various markets and MSCI
classifications.</p>
