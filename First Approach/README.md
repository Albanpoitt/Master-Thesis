 <p align="justify"> This folder contains the jupyter notebooks used in our first approach. The first approach involves projecting asset returns onto factor exposures or characteristics that resemble exposure to a risk factor in the cross-section during each period. This technique is commonly used to estimate parameter values for asset pricing models. We will project the market returns onto each of the 153 portfolios under study. <p>
 
 The folder contains the following two notebooks:
<ul>
  <li>US market: Analysis run on the US market</li>
  <li>All countries</li>
</ul>

The second notebook will enable you to re-create the figure 6 for any countries in our dataset. Fuhermore, with this notebook you can recreate figure 2, 3, 7 and 8 from the paper.
