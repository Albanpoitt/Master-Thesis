 <p align="justify"> This folder contains the jupyter notebooks used in our first approach. The first approach involves projecting asset returns onto factor exposures or characteristics that resemble exposure to a risk factor in the cross-section during each period. This technique is commonly used to estimate parameter values for asset pricing models. We will project the market returns onto each of the 153 portfolios under study. <p>
