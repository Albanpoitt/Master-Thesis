<p align="justify"> The methodology has been adjusted to work with the net factor performance compared to the market factor. This new method is equivalent to the Fama-MacBeth regression, where the only risk factor considered is the market factor. As a result, we can characterize it as an approach akin to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The net factor performance, which corresponds to the intercept of the regression, will be obtained by regressing each characteristic in our data-set against market returns. This adjustment is expected to enhance our methodology and simplify the interpretation of our findings.</p>
